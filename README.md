# predicting_sarscov2_variants

This repository containes the code used to produce results in [Predicting emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern through a One Class dynamic anomaly detection algorithm, Nicora et al 2022](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjhci-2022-100643).

## Prerequisites
Download Sarscov2 sequences from [GISAID](https://gisaid.org) and count k-mers for each spike protein. Organize the data as in the folder ./dataset_week.
In ./dataset_week/1 you can find a sample with examples of how data should be structured. It contains some sequences deposited in GISAID at week 1 of our analysis. Same for dataset_week/2 (second week)
